├── CSS bundle: 519.87 kB (67.07 kB gzipped)
└── Total JS: ~2.8MB uncompressed, ~500KB gzipped
```

#### **AFTER Optimization:**
```
✅ OPTIMIZED STRUCTURE:
├── react-vendor: 951.31 kB (172.99 kB gzipped) [Framework isolated]
├── ai-vendor: 610.95 kB (71.92 kB gzipped) [Conditional loading]

```

---

### 🎯 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED

#### **1. Advanced Bundle Splitting** ✅
- **Intelligent chunking strategy** using dynamic imports
- **Vendor isolation**: React, AI, Motion, and utilities separated
- **Component-level splitting**: Large views in individual chunks
- **Service-based chunking**: Draft, AI, and core services isolated

#### **2. Vite Configuration Optimization** ✅
```typescript
// Enhanced chunking with dynamic splitting
manualChunks: (id) => {
  if (id.includes('react')) return 'react-vendor';
  if (id.includes('framer-motion')) return 'motion-vendor';
  if (id.includes('@google/genai')) return 'ai-vendor';
  if (id.includes('EnhancedTeamHubView')) return 'team-hub-chunk';
  // ... intelligent chunk assignment
}
```

#### **3. CSS Optimization** ✅ (Partial)
- **JIT mode enabled** for better tree shaking
- **Safelist optimization** for dynamic classes
- **Content paths expanded** to include all source files
- ⚠️ **Note**: CSS bundle increased - requires Tailwind CSS purge investigation

#### **4. Performance Monitoring System** ✅
- **Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking** (LCP, FID, CLS, TTI)
- **Bundle analysis** with size tracking and recommendations
- **Component render performance** monitoring
- **Route change performance** tracking
- **Memory usage** and optimization alerts

#### **5. Advanced Preloading Manager** ✅
```typescript
// Intelligent preloading strategies
- Critical: Load immediately (Dashboard, Auth)
- High Priority: Load on idle (Team Hub, Players)  
- Medium Priority: Load on interaction (Draft Room)
- Low Priority: Load on viewport (Admin Tools)
```

#### **6. Service Worker with Intelligent Caching** ✅
```javascript
Cache Strategies Implemented:
├── App Shell: Cache First (critical resources)
├── Static Assets: Stale While Revalidate (JS/CSS/images)
├── API Calls: Network First with fallback
├── Components: Cache First with background sync
└── Navigation: SPA fallback to index.html
```
