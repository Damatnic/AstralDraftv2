# Astral Draft - Netlify Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment to astraldraft.netlify.app

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code
- Netlify account (free tier works)
- Node.js 18+ installed locally

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Ensure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin master
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in**

2. **Click "New site from Git"**

3. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Choose GitHub as your Git provider
   - Select your `AstralDraftv2` repository
   - Choose the `master` branch

4. **Configure build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build:prod`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `20`

5. **Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:**
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://astraldraft.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api
   VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
   VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
   VITE_ENABLE_PWA=true
   ```

6. **Deploy the site**

#### Option B: Manual Deployment with CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Initialize your site:**
   ```bash
   netlify init
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Domain management**
2. **Add custom domain: `astraldraft.netlify.app`**
3. **Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate**

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings > Environment variables** and add:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://astraldraft.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
VITE_ENABLE_PWA=true
VITE_ENABLE_OFFLINE=true
VITE_ENABLE_ORACLE=true
```

**Optional API Keys (for full functionality):**
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VITE_SPORTS_DATA_API_KEY=your_sports_data_api_key_here
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. **Check build logs in Netlify dashboard**
2. **Visit your deployed site**
3. **Test core functionality:**
   - Homepage loads
   - Navigation works
   - API endpoints respond (check Network tab)
   - PWA features work (try offline mode)

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

#### API Errors
- Check that Netlify Functions are deployed
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

#### Assets Not Loading
- Verify `dist` folder is being published
- Check that all assets are in the build output
- Ensure proper MIME types in `netlify.toml`

### Continuous Deployment

Once set up, your site will automatically redeploy when you push to the `master` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin master
# Site automatically rebuilds and deploys
```

### Performance Optimization

Your site is already optimized with:
- âœ… Gzip compression
- âœ… Asset caching
- âœ… Service worker for offline functionality
- âœ… Code splitting and lazy loading
- âœ… Image optimization
- âœ… PWA capabilities

### Monitoring

- **Netlify Analytics**: Built-in traffic and performance metrics
- **Build notifications**: Get notified of successful/failed deployments
- **Form handling**: Contact forms work out of the box
- **Function logs**: Monitor API performance

### Support
