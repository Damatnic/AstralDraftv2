/**
 * GEMINI SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
 * ===================================
 * 
 * REAL GOOGLE GEMINI API INTEGRATIONS (✅ Production Ready):
 * - streamOracleResponse: Real-time Oracle chat with draft context
 * - getAiDraftPick: AI-powered draft pick recommendations with persona support
 * - generatePlayerInsight: AI-generated player analysis and insights
 * - generatePlayerNickname: Creative player nicknames
 * - getAiNomination: Auction draft nomination strategy
 * - getAiBid: Intelligent bidding logic for auction drafts
 * - generateTeamBranding: Team name and avatar generation
 * - generateAiTeamProfile: AI manager profiles with personas
 * - streamAssistantResponse: Astral assistant chat functionality
 * 
 * GRACEFUL FALLBACKS:
 * - All real API functions include intelligent mock responses when API key is not configured
 * - Development-friendly error messages and guidance
 * - Consistent API surface regardless of configuration state
 * 
 * MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS (For Testing & Demo):
 * - Most other functions use mock data for development and testing purposes
 * - These can be upgraded to real API calls as needed based on product requirements
 * 
 * CONFIGURATION:
 * - Supports multiple environment variable formats: VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, API_KEY
 * - Includes checkGeminiApiStatus() for runtime configuration verification
 * - Automatic fallback to mock responses when API unavailable
