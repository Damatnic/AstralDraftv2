Calibration measures whether Oracle's confidence levels match actual outcomes. A well-calibrated system should be correct 80% of the time when it expresses 80% confidence.

**How Oracle Stays Calibrated:**

**1. Continuous Monitoring**
‚Ä¢ Track prediction accuracy by confidence level
‚Ä¢ Identify systematic over/under-confidence
‚Ä¢ Adjust algorithms based on results
‚Ä¢ Account for changing league dynamics

**2. Seasonal Adjustments**
‚Ä¢ Early season: Increase uncertainty due to small samples
‚Ä¢ Mid-season: Peak calibration with stable patterns
‚Ä¢ Late season: Adjust for playoff intensity
‚Ä¢ Weather season: Account for environmental volatility

**3. Position-Specific Calibration**
‚Ä¢ QB predictions: Generally higher confidence due to consistency
‚Ä¢ RB predictions: Lower confidence due to injury risk
‚Ä¢ WR predictions: Medium confidence with target competition
‚Ä¢ DST predictions: Lowest confidence due to volatility

**4. Machine Learning Integration**
‚Ä¢ Use historical outcomes to improve calibration
‚Ä¢ Identify overconfident scenarios
‚Ä¢ Adjust confidence bounds automatically
‚Ä¢ Learn from prediction errors`,
