**🔥 High Confidence (85-95%)**
• Strong data supporting clear favorite
• Multiple models in agreement
• Historical patterns strongly favor choice
• Low variance in similar scenarios
• *Strategy: Consider following Oracle's lead*

**⚡ Medium-High Confidence (75-84%)**
• Good data quality with clear leader
• Most models agree on direction
• Some uncertainty in magnitude
• Moderate historical reliability
• *Strategy: Evaluate your own analysis carefully*

**📊 Medium Confidence (65-74%)**
• Decent data but close competition
• Models show mixed agreement
• Historical precedent is unclear
• Several viable options
• *Strategy: Great opportunity to challenge Oracle*

**🤔 Lower Confidence (60-64%)**
• Limited or conflicting data
• High uncertainty in outcomes
• Multiple equally viable options
• Unusual circumstances present
• *Strategy: Perfect spot to trust your expertise*

**📈 Confidence Trends:**
• Early season: Generally lower due to small sample sizes
• Mid-season: Peak confidence with established patterns  
• Late season: High confidence with playoff implications
• Weather games: Reduced confidence due to volatility`

Calibration measures whether Oracle's confidence levels match actual outcomes. A well-calibrated system should be correct 80% of the time when it expresses 80% confidence.

**How Oracle Stays Calibrated:**

**1. Continuous Monitoring**
• Track prediction accuracy by confidence level
• Identify systematic over/under-confidence
• Adjust algorithms based on results
• Account for changing league dynamics

**2. Seasonal Adjustments**
• Early season: Increase uncertainty due to small samples
• Mid-season: Peak calibration with stable patterns
• Late season: Adjust for playoff intensity
• Weather season: Account for environmental volatility

**3. Position-Specific Calibration**
• QB predictions: Generally higher confidence due to consistency
• RB predictions: Lower confidence due to injury risk
• WR predictions: Medium confidence with target competition
• DST predictions: Lowest confidence due to volatility

**4. Machine Learning Integration**
• Use historical outcomes to improve calibration
• Identify overconfident scenarios
• Adjust confidence bounds automatically
• Learn from prediction errors`,

• Increases value of high-target receivers
• Reduces variance compared to touchdown dependency

**Half-PPR:**
• 0.5 points per reception
