## üíª TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Service Integration Example
```typescript
// OLD: Multiple scattered services
import { playerService } from './services/playerService';
import { tradeService } from './services/tradeService';
import { draftService } from './services/draftService';

// NEW: Consolidated core service
import { fantasyDataService } from './services/core/FantasyDataService';

// All operations through unified API
const players = await fantasyDataService.getPlayers();
const trade = await fantasyDataService.proposeTrade(tradeData);
const pick = await fantasyDataService.makeDraftPick(draftId, playerId);
```

### ML Trade Analysis Usage
```typescript
import { mlTradeAnalyzer } from './services/core/MLTradeAnalyzer';

const analysis = await mlTradeAnalyzer.analyzeTrade({
  teamA: {
    teamId: 'team1',
    giving: ['player1', 'player2'],
    receiving: ['player3']
  },
  teamB: {
    teamId: 'team2',
    giving: ['player3'],
    receiving: ['player1', 'player2']
  }
}, leagueId);

// Returns comprehensive analysis with recommendations
if (analysis.recommendations.accept && analysis.fairnessScore > 40) {
  // Proceed with trade
}
```

### Dynasty Features Usage
```typescript
import { dynastyLeagueService } from './services/core/DynastyLeagueService';

// Sign player contract
await dynastyLeagueService.signPlayerContract(playerId, teamId, {
